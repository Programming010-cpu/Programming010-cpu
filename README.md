# Zmyrna • 100 Moments Minted
*A protocol that mints nostalgia, one token at a time.*

> “Some winters are loud enough to echo for years.” – *River‑Road Nocturne*

## ✨ What is Zmyrna?
Zmyrna is an **art‑backed ERC‑721 collection** that binds autobiographical vignettes to on‑chain metadata.  
Each of the 100 tokens is an immutable snapshot of a half‑remembered night—bikes, neon rivers, contraband ramen.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Fully on‑chain metadata | ✅ |
| Story‑image pairing via IPFS | ✅ |
| DAO‑gated narrative extensions | 🚧 *(roadmap Q4 2025)* |
